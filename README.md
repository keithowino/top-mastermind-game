#   TOP MASTERMIND GAME

This is a game whereby there are 2 players one being the mastermind the other the code breaker. On one end of a specially designed board the mastermind places 4 pegs of different colors on a hidden pit for the code breaker to cipher. After the masterminds code has been entered from the other opposite end of the board the code breaker begins the cipher process by attempting predictions in 4 pairs until the mastermind proves prediction to be a match or turns of predictions come to an end.
